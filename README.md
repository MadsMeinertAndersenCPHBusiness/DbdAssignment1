# DbdAssignment1

We chose to use the joint-table strategy, because it complies with the first, second and third normalform and still efficient enough when we only have two kinds of pets. 

## The code

We have a DbDriverManager that connects to our postgresql database and then we have service (PetService) that initializes the connection and communicates with the database.

To see how the program works, you need to:

1. Clone the project
2. Change the string url in DbDriverManager.java to your own url
3. Execute "Assignment1.sql" script 
4. Run the main method in Main.java
